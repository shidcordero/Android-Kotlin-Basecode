# Android-Kotlin-Basecode
An Android Kotlin Basecode for developers who want to start developing android mobile application. This code shows an application developed with the latest best practices on Android.

The following technologies used in this project:

- MVP Architecture
- RxAndroid
- Dagger 2
- Retrofit 2
- Data Binding

On this implementation, no actual Web Service API. I use https://my-json-server.typicode.com/ to create a Fake Online REST API Server. You can find my server here(https://my-json-server.typicode.com/shidcordero12/android-json-server).

Note: 
This is still an ongoing project.

Done:
- User List
- Splash Screen implementation(new)

Todo:
- Login Screen
- CRUD implementation on User
- more coming features
